| BASIC USAGE |
+-------------+

mule [-config <your-config.xml>]

    (runs in the foreground, stop with Ctrl-C)

mule start|stop|restart [-config <your-config.xml>]

    (runs in the background as a daemon)

+---------------------+
| CONFIGURATION FILES |
+---------------------+

If the "-config" parameter is not specified, a default file name of 
"mule-config.xml" will be assumed.

You may optionally specify more than one file as a comma-separated list (this 
can be useful for splitting up your Mule configuration to make it more 
manageable).

Your configuration file(s) need to be on the classpath prior to startup.  A 
convenient way to achieve this is by placing them in the "conf" or "lib/user" 
directory.

Alternatively, you can specify an explicit path to their location on the file 
system as follows:

mule -config file:/path/to/my-config.xml

+---------------------+
| CLASSES & LIBRARIES |
+---------------------+

Any user classes or libraries used by your configuration should be placed in
"lib/user" before starting up the server.

Please note that hot deployment is not yet supported, so you will need to 
restart the server for configuration changes and/or new classes/libraries to 
take effect.

+-----------------------+
| CONFIGURATION BUILDER |
+-----------------------+
By default, the "org.mule.config.spring.SpringXmlConfigurationBuilder" class 
will be used to interpret your configuration file(s).  If you wish to use a 
different configuration builder, you can specify it using the "-builder" option.  
For example, to use the Scripting configuration builder you could specify:

mule -config my-scripted-config.xml \
     -builder org.mule.config.builders.ScriptConfigurationBuilder

+------------------+
| ADVANCED OPTIONS |
+------------------+

Mule uses the Java Service Wrapper (http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org) to 
control the JVM from your native OS.  The wrapper provides many advanced options 
and features.  For more information, see
